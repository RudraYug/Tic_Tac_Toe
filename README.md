# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game can be played by two players who take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply download or clone this repository to your local machine.


## Prerequisites

- [**Python 3.x**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [**Tkinter library**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
## Installation

To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone or download the project code from the Github repository: https://github.com/username/repo

The game uses the Tkinter library, which is included with Python by default, so no additional installation is needed.


## Gameplay

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 board, and two players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the board.
- The player who places three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
## Usage

To start the game, run the `tictactoe.py` script. The game window will appear, and the first player will be randomly selected. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of squares. Players take turns clicking on the squares to place their mark (either X or O) on the board.

The game will continue until one player wins, or the board is full and the game ends in a tie. If a winner is determined, the winning squares will be highlighted in green. If the game ends in a tie, all squares will be highlighted in yellow.

To start a new game, click the `Restart` button at the top of the window.


## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code in the `tictactoe.py` file. Here are some suggestions:

- Change the names or symbols of the players by modifying the `players` list at the top of the file.
- Adjust the size of the game board by changing the buttons list, and the nested loops that create the buttons in the `mainloop()` function.
- Change the appearance of the game board and buttons by modifying the `Button()` and `Label()` arguments in the `mainloop()` function.
- Add additional features or game modes, such as a two-player mode, by modifying the existing code or adding new functions.
